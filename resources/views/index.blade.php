        <p id="mediumtext"> - I have the motivation to learn new stuff
            <br> - I will be glad of feedback and implement (most) in my code

            <p><u class="underline-small" style="line-height: 1.45">Another reason is that when I have an idea I try and
                    code it which also involves a lot of learning because of new concepts. A great example is a small
                    program I made this summer that calculates the time it will take you to go from point A to point B
                    on a hypothetical rail line, plus, it also informs you how many stops you will make along the way.
                    Point A and Point B are given by you and the program is pretty flexible since only the distances
                    between each station are given. (AKA there isn't a huge list that contains every possible distance
                    from all the stations) (Yes, I am a train nerd as well) The key takeaway from this program I made
                    which took about 5-6 workhours is that I was introduced to a new library and had to solve multiple
                    problems that required solutions I did not have the knowledge of. Overall it was an awesome
                    experience as the program functions as intended and it doesn't have any bugs. (A huge motivation was
                    the topic of the program which made it rather interesting to me)
