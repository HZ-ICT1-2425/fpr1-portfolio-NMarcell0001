        <h2 id="blogtext" align="center">A very basic level of python, as the high school leaving exam requires it,
            plus, in
            the recent weeks/months I actually got interested in it on a "higher" level, but that's it, nothing major
            really. I know how to write in a txt file, how to read from one, I can use for , while loops and essentially
            the
            very basic stuff in python. I could also send examples if that helps</h2>
